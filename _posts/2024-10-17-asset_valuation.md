## Introduction

The shareholders of a corporation always seek maximum value for their investments and aim for an honest and accurate share price. To achieve this, the company needs to invest in assets that are worth more than their cost. In this article, we'll explore the basics of how assets are valued and how capital investments are made, providing several examples to illustrate key financial concepts like net present value, discount factors, perpetuities, and annuities.

Asset valuation can sometimes be straightforward. For instance, in real estate, it is possible to hire an appraiser to estimate the value of a property. Suppose you own a warehouse, and an appraiser estimates that it is worth $2.5 million. This value is likely close to what the property would sell for, as the appraiser uses current market trends and recent transactions to arrive at that figure.

However, valuing corporate assets like equipment or a production line can be much more challenging. Such assets are not bought and sold frequently, making it essential to understand the underlying principles of asset valuation, which we'll delve into in this article.

## Present Value and Future Value

### Time Value of Money

One fundamental concept in finance is the time value of money, which suggests that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. This concept is based on the idea that money can be invested to earn interest, increasing in value over time.

Suppose you invest $200 in a bank account with an annual interest rate of 6%. After one year, the value of your investment will be:

$$
\text{Future Value} = 200 \times (1 + 0.06) = 200 \times 1.06 = 212
$$

In the first year, you earn $12 as interest, and the value of your investment grows to $212.

If you keep the investment for a second year, you earn interest on both your initial investment ($200) and the previous year's interest ($12). This is called **compound interest**, and your wealth will grow as follows:

$$
\text{Value after 2 years} = 212 \times 1.06 = 224.72
$$

In general, if you invest an amount $P$ for $t$ years at an interest rate of $r$, the future value can be calculated as:

$$
\text{Future Value} = P \times (1 + r)^t
$$

For example, if you invest $300 at an interest rate of 8% for 3 years:

$$
\text{Future Value} = 300 \times (1.08)^3 = 300 \times 1.2597 = 377.91
$$

### Calculating Present Value

To determine whether an investment is worth making, we often need to calculate the **present value (PV)** of future cash flows. Present value represents how much a future sum of money is worth today, given a specific interest rate.

Suppose you want to know how much you need to invest today to receive $500 in 4 years, assuming an interest rate of 5%. You can use the present value formula:

$$
\text{Present Value} = \frac{500}{(1 + 0.05)^4} = \frac{500}{1.2155} = 411.35
$$

This means that if you invest $411.35 today at 5%, it will grow to $500 in 4 years.

In general, the present value of a future cash flow $C_t$ occurring in year $t$ can be calculated as:

$$
\text{Present Value (PV)} = \frac{C_t}{(1 + r)^t}
$$

Where:
- $C_t$ is the future cash flow in year $t$.
- $r$ is the discount rate (or interest rate).

For instance, if you expect to receive $1,000 in 5 years, and the discount rate is 6%, the present value is:

$$
\text{PV} = \frac{1000}{(1 + 0.06)^5} = \frac{1000}{1.3382} = 747.26
$$

### Discount Factor

The **discount factor** measures the present value of one dollar received in the future. It is calculated as:

$$
\text{Discount Factor} = \frac{1}{(1 + r)^t}
$$

For example, with a discount rate of 4%, the discount factor for 3 years is:

$$
\text{DF}_3 = \frac{1}{(1 + 0.04)^3} = \frac{1}{1.1249} = 0.8890
$$

This means that a dollar received in 3 years is worth $0.8890 today if the discount rate is 4%.

## Net Present Value (NPV)

**Net Present Value (NPV)** is used to decide whether an investment is worth undertaking. It is calculated by subtracting the initial investment from the present value of future cash flows.

Suppose you have an investment opportunity that requires an initial investment of $300,000 and will provide a return of $340,000 after 2 years. The interest rate is 5%. The present value of the future return is:

$$
\text{PV} = \frac{340,000}{(1 + 0.05)^2} = \frac{340,000}{1.1025} = 308,326.89
$$

The NPV of the investment is:

$$
\text{NPV} = 308,326.89 - 300,000 = 8,326.89
$$

Since the NPV is positive, the investment is worth undertaking.

In general, the NPV formula for an investment with initial cash flow $C_0$ (usually negative, representing the initial outlay) and future cash flows $C_t$ over $T$ periods is:

$$
\text{NPV} = C_0 + \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{C_t}{(1 + r)^t}
$$

Where:
- $C_0$ is the initial investment (a negative value).
- $C_t$ are the future cash flows.
- $r$ is the discount rate.
- $T$ is the number of periods.

## Perpetuities and Annuities
### Perpetuities

A **perpetuity** is a type of investment that pays a fixed amount ($C$) each year indefinitely. The present value (PV) of a perpetuity can be derived from the formula for an infinite series of payments. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step derivation:

$$
PV = \frac{C}{(1+r)} + \frac{C}{(1+r)^2} + \frac{C}{(1+r)^3} + \cdots
$$

Multiplying both sides by $(1 + r)$:

$$
(1 + r) \cdot PV = C + \frac{C}{(1+r)} + \cdots + \frac{C}{(1+r)^{T-1}}
$$

Subtracting the original equation from this result:

$$
r \cdot PV = C
$$

Finally, solving for PV:

$$
PV = \frac{C}{r}
$$

For example, suppose you want to endow a scholarship that pays $10,000$ per year forever, and the discount rate is 5%. The present value of the endowment is:

$$
PV = \frac{10,000}{0.05} = 200,000
$$

This means you need to invest $200,000$ today to provide $10,000$ per year in perpetuity.

### Annuities

An **annuity** is an investment that pays a fixed amount ($C$) each year for a specified number of years ($T$). The present value (PV) of an annuity can be derived similarly to perpetuities but with a finite number of terms. The formula is:

$$
PV = \frac{C}{(1+r)} + \frac{C}{(1+r)^2} + \cdots + \frac{C}{(1+r)^T}
$$

To derive this, start by multiplying both sides by $(1 + r)$:

$$
(1 + r) \cdot PV = C + \frac{C}{(1+r)} + \cdots + \frac{C}{(1+r)^{T-1}}
$$

Subtract the original equation from this result:

$$
r \cdot PV = C - \frac{C}{(1+r)^T}
$$

Solving for PV gives:

$$
PV = \frac{C}{r} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{(1+r)^T} \right)
$$

For example, if you receive $5,000$ per year for 4 years, and the discount rate is 6%, the present value is:

$$
PV = 5000 \times \left( \frac{1 - (1 + 0.06)^{-4}}{0.06} \right) = 5000 \times 3.4651 = 17,325.50
$$

### Growing Perpetuities

A **growing perpetuity** pays a cash flow that increases at a constant rate $g$ each year. The present value (PV) of a growing perpetuity is derived by considering that each cash flow grows by a factor of $(1 + g)$:

$$
PV = \frac{C_1}{(1+r)} + \frac{C_1(1+g)}{(1+r)^2} + \cdots
$$

Multiplying both sides by $(1 + r)$:

$$
(1 + r) \cdot PV = C_1 + \frac{C_1(1+g)}{(1+r)} + \cdots
$$

Subtracting the original equation from this result:

$$
\left( r - g \right) \cdot PV = C_1
$$

Solving for PV gives:

$$
PV = \frac{C_1}{r - g}, \quad r > g
$$

For example, suppose you want to provide $8,000$ per year in perpetuity, with the amount growing at 3% per year, and the discount rate is 7%. The present value is:

$$
PV = \frac{8,000}{0.07 - 0.03} = \frac{8,000}{0.04} = 200,000
$$

### Growing Annuities

A **growing annuity** is an investment that pays a cash flow that grows at a constant rate for a specified number of years. The present value (PV) of a growing annuity that pays $C_1$ in the first year and grows at rate $g$ for $T$ years is derived from:

$$
PV = \frac{C_1}{(1+r)} + \frac{C_1(1+g)}{(1+r)^2} + \cdots + \frac{C_1(1+g)^{T-1}}{(1+r)^T}
$$

Multiplying both sides by $(1 + r)$ and following similar steps as for growing perpetuities, we get:

$$
PV = C_1 \times \left( \frac{1 - \left( \frac{1 + g}{1 + r} \right)^T}{r - g} \right)
$$

For example, suppose you receive $3,000$ in the first year, with payments growing at 2% per year for 5 years, and the discount rate is 6%. The present value is:

$$
PV = 3000 \times \left( \frac{1 - \left( \frac{1 + 0.02}{1 + 0.06} \right)^5}{0.06 - 0.02} \right) = 3000 \times 4.7135 = 14,140.50
$$

### Interest Rates: Quoted vs. Effective

Interest rates can be quoted in different ways, and it's important to understand the difference between the **quoted interest rate** (also called the nominal interest rate) and the **effective interest rate**. The quoted interest rate is the annual rate typically provided by financial institutions, but it does not take into account how often interest is compounded during the year. The **effective annual rate** (EAR), on the other hand, incorporates the effects of compounding and provides a more accurate measure of the cost of borrowing or the return on an investment.

#### Quoted (Nominal) Interest Rate

The **quoted interest rate** is the nominal annual interest rate, denoted by $r_{nom}$. For example, if a bank offers a loan with an annual interest rate of 8%, this is the nominal rate. However, the actual cost of borrowing depends on how frequently interest is compounded. 

#### Compounding Frequency

Interest can be compounded multiple times a year (quarterly, monthly, daily, etc.). The frequency of compounding significantly affects the total interest accrued. The number of times interest is compounded per year is denoted by $m$. For example:

- **Annual compounding** ($m = 1$): Interest is compounded once per year.
- **Semi-annual compounding** ($m = 2$): Interest is compounded twice per year.
- **Quarterly compounding** ($m = 4$): Interest is compounded four times per year.
- **Monthly compounding** ($m = 12$): Interest is compounded twelve times per year.

#### Effective Annual Rate (EAR)

The **effective annual rate (EAR)**, also known as the annual equivalent rate (AER), gives the actual interest rate accounting for compounding over the year. It is derived from the nominal rate and the compounding frequency. The formula to calculate the EAR is:

$$
EAR = \left( 1 + \frac{r_{nom}}{m} \right)^m - 1
$$

Where:
- $r_{nom}$ is the nominal interest rate (quoted rate).
- $m$ is the number of compounding periods per year.

The formula adjusts for the frequency of compounding by dividing the nominal interest rate by $m$ and raising it to the power of $m$, which accounts for compounding at each interval. Finally, subtracting $1$ gives the effective annual rate.

#### Example of EAR Calculation

Let's walk through an example. Suppose a bank offers an 8% nominal interest rate compounded quarterly ($m = 4$). To find the effective annual rate (EAR), we use the formula:

$$
EAR = \left( 1 + \frac{0.08}{4} \right)^4 - 1
$$

Simplifying the expression:

$$
EAR = \left( 1 + 0.02 \right)^4 - 1
$$

$$
EAR = (1.02)^4 - 1
$$

$$
EAR = 1.0824 - 1 = 0.0824
$$

Thus, the effective annual rate is:

$$
EAR = 0.0824 \times 100 = 8.24\%
$$

This means that with quarterly compounding, the actual interest rate you would effectively pay or earn over a year is 8.24%, not just the 8% quoted.

### Continuous Compounding

In some cases, interest is compounded continuously rather than at discrete intervals. Continuous compounding means that interest is added an infinite number of times per year, resulting in a slightly higher rate compared to periodic compounding.

The formula for continuous compounding can be derived from the definition of the mathematical constant $e$. The effective annual rate (EAR) for continuous compounding is derived from the limit of the compounding formula as the number of compounding periods ($m$) approaches infinity:

$$
EAR = \lim_{m \to \infty} \left( 1 + \frac{r_{nom}}{m} \right)^m - 1
$$

This limit evaluates to:

$$
EAR = e^{r_{nom}} - 1
$$

Where $e$ is Euler's number, approximately 2.718. This formula shows the maximum interest that can be earned with continuous compounding.

#### Example of Continuous Compounding (with 8% Interest)

Suppose a bank offers an 8% nominal interest rate, but interest is compounded continuously. To calculate the effective annual rate (EAR), we use the continuous compounding formula:

$$
EAR = e^{0.08} - 1
$$

Using the approximation for $e^{0.08}$:

$$
EAR = 1.08329 - 1 = 0.08329
$$

Thus, the effective annual rate with continuous compounding is:

$$
EAR = 0.08329 \times 100 = 8.33\%
$$

#### Comparison: Quarterly vs. Continuous Compounding

In this case, with an 8% nominal interest rate:
- **Quarterly compounding** gives an EAR of 8.24%.
- **Continuous compounding** gives an EAR of 8.33%.

This shows that continuous compounding results in a slightly higher effective interest rate than quarterly compounding, though the difference is not large.

### Summary

- **Quoted interest rate** is the nominal rate provided by financial institutions.
- **EAR** (Effective Annual Rate) accounts for compounding and provides a true measure of the cost of borrowing or the return on investment.
- **Continuous compounding** yields the highest possible EAR by calculating interest an infinite number of times per year, slightly increasing the overall rate compared to periodic compounding.

Understanding the distinction between these rates helps you make more informed financial decisions.
