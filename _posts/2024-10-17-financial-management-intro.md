Corporations constantly face two crucial decisions: **investment** and **financing**. These decisions, when made effectively, help increase the value of the business, ultimately benefiting shareholders. 


## **Investment vs. Financing Decisions**

Corporations use their resources to acquire **real assets**, which are tangible and intangible resources used to generate **cash flows** and ultimately income. Examples of real assets include:

- **Tangible assets** like a factory, machinery, and physical stores.
- **Intangible assets** such as patents, trademarks, and brand value.

On the other hand, **financial assets** are the tools corporations use to acquire real assets. Financial assets include loans, corporate bonds, and stock sales. The financial manager's job is to figure out how to invest in real assets while effectively raising the money to fund these investments.

### **The Investment Decision**

The **investment decision** deals with the allocation of capital to various real assets. A corporation needs to decide which projects to invest in. This is sometimes referred to as **capital budgeting** or **capital expenditure (CAPEX) decisions**.

For example, if a company like Tesla decides to expand its electric car production, it would need to acquire new factories and machinery—these are **real assets**. Let's say Tesla plans to invest \$15 billion in a new factory to produce electric trucks, this require capital that could have been invested in another project or in the market. It is an investment decision.
### **The Financing Decision**

The **financing decision** involves determining how to raise funds to support the corporation's investments. The company might borrow from banks, issue bonds, or sell new stock. This is called the **capital structure** decision—deciding on the mix of **debt** and **equity** financing.

For example, if Tesla needs \$15 billion to fund its new factory, it could either:

- **Issue Bonds**: Borrow \$15 billion by issuing 10-year bonds at a 4% interest rate.
- **Issue Stock**: Issue additional shares to raise \$15 billion from the market.
- **Retain Earnings**: Use \$15 billion generated from previous profits.

The decision depends on the relative costs and benefits of debt versus equity, and the potential impact on shareholders.

## **The Goal of Financial Management**

Corporations have numerous shareholders, each with different preferences. Despite differences in risk tolerance, wealth, and investment timelines, shareholders generally agree on one goal—maximizing the **value of the corporation** and its **stock price**.

### **The Key Challenge: Adding Value**

The **name of the game** in financial management is to add value. This requires thoughtful judgment, understanding of financial concepts, and the creative ability to make the right choices in unpredictable circumstances. Financial managers must make investments that **maximize the firm's value** and increase **shareholder wealth**.

For example, consider the decision to invest in renewable energy projects. Suppose a utility company has \$10 billion in cash. The financial manager can decide to invest this in solar farms, or it could return the cash to shareholders as dividends. If a project yields a **return** higher than what shareholders can earn elsewhere (in the market, at a similar level of risk), it adds value and would be a good investment. Else, the money should be returned to investors as dividends

## **Investment Opportunities and the Opportunity Cost of Capital**

When a corporation invests in a project, it incurs an **opportunity cost**—the return the shareholders could have earned if they had invested that money elsewhere.

In corporate finance, the **opportunity cost of capital** represents the **minimum acceptable rate of return** on investment projects. The opportunity cost is determined by the returns shareholders could get by investing in the financial market, at a similar level of risk.

### **Example: Investing in a Solar Farm**

Let's assume a corporation, "GreenCo," has \$5 billion to invest in a new solar energy plant. Shareholders could invest this money in financial markets and earn a return of 8% with similar risk. Therefore, the **opportunity cost of capital** is 8%. The solar project needs to offer a return higher than 8% for shareholders to consider it worthwhile.

If the solar project is expected to return 12%, it's a good investment as it exceeds the 8% opportunity cost of capital. If it yields only 6%, shareholders would prefer to invest in the market themselves.


## **Financing Decisions and Capital Structure**

When raising capital, a firm must decide between **debt** and **equity** financing. Debt financing involves borrowing funds and paying interest, while equity financing involves selling additional shares of stock. The decision depends on many factors, including the cost of borrowing, risk tolerance, and the company’s overall financial health.

### **Capital Structure: Debt vs. Equity**

- **Debt Financing**: Borrowing money through loans or bonds. For example, if GreenCo issues a bond for \$5 billion at an interest rate of 5%, it must pay the interest regularly until the bond matures.
- **Equity Financing**: Selling shares of stock. If GreenCo chooses equity, it could sell new shares in the stock market to raise the \$5 billion. Shareholders then own a larger share of the company.

The **optimal capital structure** is the right balance between debt and equity. This balance minimizes the **cost of capital** and maximizes the firm's value. Finding this balance is crucial because high debt levels increase **financial risk**, while too much equity might dilute current shareholders' ownership.

## **Corporate Governance and Incentives**

The success of a corporation doesn’t only depend on investments and financing but also on how well it motivates its managers and employees to work in the shareholders' interests. This involves having effective **corporate governance** and well-aligned incentives.

### **Incentives to Align Interests**

Imagine if a CEO’s compensation is entirely salary-based. There's little motivation to take risks or create value for shareholders. In contrast, if their compensation is tied to **stock options**, they have a vested interest in increasing the firm's stock price—aligning their actions with shareholder goals.

For example, if a CEO has options that can be exercised when the stock price hits \$100 (and it’s currently \$80), they are incentivized to work hard to grow the company to drive the stock price up.

## **What is a Corporation?**

Before diving too deeply into financial concepts, it is essential to understand the legal entity called a **corporation**.

A **corporation** is a **legal entity** distinct from its owners (shareholders). It can make contracts, sue or be sued, borrow money, and make investments—just like a person. The corporation's owners have **limited liability**, meaning they can't be held responsible for the corporation's debts beyond their investment.

Corporations can be **public** or **private**. In public corporations, shares are traded on the stock exchange, while private companies have a limited number of shareholders.

The **separation of ownership and control** means that shareholders (owners) aren't directly involved in running the company—instead, they hire managers to do that. This separation allows the corporation to **exist indefinitely**, as ownership and management can change without affecting the corporation's existence.

## **The Role of Financial Managers**

The role of a **financial manager** is to ensure that money raised from shareholders and lenders is wisely invested and that returns flow back to investors. Essentially, financial managers act as intermediaries between **investors** and the **firm’s operations**.

They need to constantly make **investment decisions** and **financing decisions** that align with the **shareholders’ best interests**.

## **The Agency Problem**

The **agency problem** arises from the **separation of ownership and control**. Shareholders want managers to maximize their wealth, but managers might be tempted to pursue their interests instead—such as perks, bonuses, or job security.

For instance, suppose a manager decides to purchase luxury office furniture for \$500,000. The decision might not add value to shareholders and could be seen as wasteful. Shareholders face **agency costs** when management acts in its own interest.

### **Mitigating Agency Problems**

**Corporate governance** mechanisms help mitigate agency problems by ensuring that managers act in the shareholders' best interests:

- **Compensation Plans**: Linking management compensation to stock performance.
- **Board of Directors**: The board, elected by shareholders, is responsible for overseeing management decisions.
- **Takeovers**: Poorly performing companies are vulnerable to **takeovers**, encouraging managers to maximize value to avoid being replaced.
- **Shareholder Pressure**: If shareholders are unhappy with management, they can push for changes or sell their shares, reducing stock prices and management bonuses.

## **Summary**

In summary, the financial manager's primary objective is to **increase shareholder value**. This involves making sound **investment decisions** (allocating capital to projects that yield returns above the opportunity cost of capital) and **financing decisions** (choosing the right mix of debt and equity). Moreover, **corporate governance** and well-designed incentive schemes are essential to ensuring that managers act in the best interests of shareholders.

To add value, investments must yield a **rate of return** that exceeds the **opportunity cost of capital**. And good corporate governance helps align the interests of shareholders and managers, ensuring everyone pulls in the same direction.

Corporate finance is all about about making decisions that add value—balancing investment, financing, and incentives to benefit shareholders and build a sustainable, profitable corporation.
